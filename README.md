# PHP GPT-4 Function Calling Example

This is an example code for using the OpenAI GPT-4 API's function calling capability. There is a `chatbot.php` in the repostiory, which is a command line chatbot that you can use to interact with ChatGPT.

There is also a work-in-progress ChatGPT PHP library in the `library/ChatGPT.php` file that can work with function calling.

The chatbot has been programmed, using GPT-4 function calling, to answer to queries about the weather with "It's nice and sunny". It also has a shopping cart, into which you can add products and list the contents of.

## Usage

Export your OpenAI API key:

```console
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Run the chatbot:
```
$ php chatbot.php
```
